What line does the code fail on?
	line 75 of LinkedQueue

What is the error?
	Invariant wrong at the end of remove()
	"tail should be null if head is null"

What is the case where the error happens?
	When removing the last item in the queue so there are no more elements/nodes left in the list

What should happen in this case?
	In this case, since we've removed all the items, head now points to head.next which is null. 
	Therefore, tail should also be null in order to pass the invariant, which makes sense because 
	right now, tail is still pointing to the item we removed. We should check that if the list is empty, 
	or if head is null, and then also set tail null. I tried this two ways: 
	if (_numItems == 0) {
		_tail = null;
	}
	and:
	if (_head == null) {
		_tail = head;
	}
	both passed the invariant and caused the tests to pass.
