Describe the problem!
Pay attention to the values in the variables pane. Whatâ€™s going wrong?

The current index when we first call the method is set to 5. 
Then, when we execute the for loop header, currentIndex gets set to 0. We then
check if the 0 ith element, in this case "to", is in the printed list. If not, 
we count the occurences of this element with countOccurencesWithIterator, add 
"to" to the printed list and print it. The issue is that, upon return from the 
countOccurencesWithIterator call, we have now moved the currentIndex back to 
5. Therefore, when we try and enter the for loop again, it won't because we are
now back at the end of "this".
